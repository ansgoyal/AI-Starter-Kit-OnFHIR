# OnFHIR - Starter Kit for Azure API for FHIR 

This respository contains example code and scenarios that shows the use of the [Azure API for FHIR](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/healthcare-apis) PaaS server to populate and consume patient and financial data. 
Some sample codes are used from the [FHIR Server Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server-samples).

The high level solution architecture includes: 
#### * Generate Data: Generate FHIR data using Synthea
#### * Ingest Data: Upload the generated data into Azure Blob Storage. Ingest into Azure API for FHIR using Azure Function
#### * Store Data: Store FHIR data in Azure API for FHIR service
#### * Prepare and Analyze Data: Prepare data using Azure Data Factory and Azure Databricks. Store in Azure SQL DB. Analyze using PowerBI.
