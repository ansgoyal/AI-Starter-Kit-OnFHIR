# OnFHIR - Starter Kit for Azure API for FHIR 

This respository contains example code and scenarios that shows the use of the [Azure API for FHIR](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/healthcare-apis) PaaS server to populate and consume patient and financial data. 
Some sample codes are used from the [FHIR Server Samples] (https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server-samples).

The high level solution architecture includes: 
#### * Generate Data FHIR data using Synthea
## Store the generated FHIR data into Azure Blob Storage to be loaded into Azure API for FHIR using Azure Function
## Store FHIR data in Azure API for FHIR
## Prepare the FHIR data using Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks and Azure SQL DB to be consume for analysis by PowerBI.
