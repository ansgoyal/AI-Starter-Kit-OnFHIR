# OnFHIR - Starter Kit for Azure API for FHIR 

This respository contains example code and scenarios that show use of the [Azure API for FHIR](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/healthcare-apis) PaaS server to populate and consume patient and financial data. 
This uses some sample code available from the [FHIR Server Samples] (https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server-samples).

The overall solution architecture is a combination of: configuration of Synthea to create sample data, load that data into Azure API for FHIR and consume that data using Azure services.
